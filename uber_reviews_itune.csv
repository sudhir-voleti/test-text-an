"Wheel chair vehicles not practical for some","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id412577199","kittenb21","3.440.10003","2","Your app doesn't have a place for me to send feedback in detail, and when there’s not an option for what is my problem so I’m here publicly giving my feedback, stupid it is. I keep getting paired wheel chair vans, and I don’t know until they show up... these vehicles are very uncomfortable for me to sit in actually, the seats are all the way at the back and are high high up my feet have nowhere to rest they don’t touch the ground and your head hits the top of the ceiling so you bunch the whole ride . I have back problems and if we were to get hit I wouldn’t be safe at all. I could see this vehicle being useful for wheel chair bound people’s but for me it’s really not practical. I had only three bags of groceries and there wasn’t room to put them in the trunk (there isn’t really a trunk) so we put them on the floor but they were sliding all around it was uncomfortable/ stressful, you charge 13 for short rides and I get in this car. I’m starting to use Lyft now, mostly because there was no where at least within reason to give feedback on the app. I get that these vehicles are around but I don’t want to be paired with one in the future you need to let people type feedback. You’re list of problems isn’t enough. I used to love uber easy, not as expensive, and normal rides. I think you could put “wheel chair vehicle” in the title of the car so I could cancel. Or make it so I could opt out of that type of car and not get paired. Someone who needs a wheel chair ride could have used it and enjoyed it. I got paired with one twice in a week.",2021-01-20 18:56:30

It’s ridiculous. Drivers sit and don’t move and also don’t cancel so YOU have to cancel after waiting for them to even move towards your direction, and end up getting charged a fee. Now uber has also made it a pain to dispute a charge, and tries to prompt you to sign in through the desktop page and not just give you the options to choose what your issue was through the app.

Sometimes I just request a ride, it loads for a while, puts a hold on a card, keeps me waiting for minutes while Uber is allegedly “looking for a driver” and then it just throws me back to home page of the app. It’s impossible to reach support. Nope. Absolutely no way. Right now I’m trying to use my Tesla voucher listed as my payment method and Uber still keeps charging and double charging my card. I’d never go back to Uber if not for this voucher. Save yourself sometime and download Lyft or even call a regular cab - should be faster and cheaper",2021-01-19 07:27:10

It’s more an inconvenience to me then anything. Since I live in an area not close to many Uber drivers it’s harder for me to even get a ride.
Most of the time it’ll stay at the “connecting you to a driver” stage then fail to even connect me to one anyways. 
I’m not even able to even schedule a ride if I could because it’ll usually tell me the pick up area is out of range. 
If some of those issues were fixed maybe I could give it a higher rating.

There has to be a set money cap for distance.
I was going down a few blocks to my workplace, $10—said the estimation. Then as i’m awaiting a driver for them to pick, the drivers want to range the price up to $35.
I live in Koreatown, Los Angeles—hitching an Uber to PACOYMA is $30 —somehow going down a few blocks by USC should strike a value of $30?
Yeah, you got me messed up.
Some of these Uber drivers are straight up scammers..do not use this app in emergencies, as they will find away to push the price up $20 just for being grubby and incase of emergency you wont have the security of someone wanting to accept your price, you will simply be out an extra $20 because you needed to get to work, or maybe you were in what could be a suspicious situation.

I had a lot of faith in Uber’s ability to get me from the airport home but, I had a ridiculous experience today. While at lax I tried to get a ride home today and it said the price would be 41-49$ so I requested a ride. Then as I waited at the Uber pickup they couldn’t seem to find me a driver, for nearly an hour I waited until they found one but it was 165$. So I declined the up charge. After a few ridiculous prices surcharges offers by the app I eventually agreed to take a ride for 81$. I had been waiting for about an hour an a half so I took the nearly 2x price of what they kept showing me on my phone when initially requested a ride. Now I had a nice driver and don’t want his promised money taken away but, I agreed to a pay 81$ price but they charged my card for 87$. In the grand scheme it’s not that much money difference but I think it’s ridiculous that they don’t have a system to even hear me out so I can explain what happened. It’s terrible that you can agree to a certain price and be charged something else without any way of it being challenged. I went through all of the different support options on the app and they wouldn’t do anything. Please give a phone number I can contact you at or something because this is ba and while I understand surge pricing is the whole business model I don’t think it’s part of the business model to change the price of the ride once you have already taken it.",2021-01-04 08:31:42

I didn’t it for 2 months, because I never saw a confirmation of payment, or Uber a verification that I wanted to go further with the payment.  I was charged &24.99 for the month of October, and November.  Yes, I did realize payment had come out, but I recently lost my mother unexpectedly, so I wasn’t focused on the payment at the moment.  Anyway, I don’t even know why Uber would charge me$24.99, because I live in San Antonio TX, and we don’t even have the ride pass here, and the closest city that does is Austin, and their rates are $14.99!! The $24.99 is a California rate!  I received one month, but I want all of my money back Uber!!",2020-12-25 02:13:47

Then I’m left scrambling and I’m late for work. If you can not ensure the driver accepting those “reserved“ times will be accountable and reliable then get rid of the feature. This is the second time it’s happened. The first was a reservation to catch a flight for a vacation.

If it’s not caught they gain more money off of us. I’ve had items missing and it’s not fair to have to wait 3-5 or even 1-3 business days for our money back or a correction when you didn’t have to wait all those days for our payment for the food or ride.

Your a company servicing the ppl not your own individual entity servicing yourself. That’s what you do at home in your personal life.

Now I’m at the point where I’m done with all the services. I just want my refund and payment methods cleared out of the system since no one is really trying to help me resolve my issue. 

Phone support doesn’t seem to help either. I’ve been told that the chat feature will be helpful in resolving my issue but that hasn’t been true.

Since my PayPal account was charged without notice nor a receipt it gives way to let me believe that it was a fraudulent charge from the company. I’ve stated multiple times in my “support ticket” that there has to be an internal audit system to track what API calls my user makes (that would cause charged to appear). No one wants to check that. I’ve given all the payment information I can. And I’m still being asked the same questions. I don’t have a case number so I can’t paste it here, but to me this shows a true lack of transparency on how/why a charge was made and a receipt hasn’t been sent.

I want to close my account, but I do fear more fraudulent charges will come through since I can’t get an explanation on the first one, nor a reversal, nor any follow up to my comments in my “support ticket”.

I have to pay $25 to just go to work when it’s usually 10-12 dollars. The reason to that is because of the weather which I feel like they shouldn’t even do that. Uber is literally full of scams and I’m upset that I’m realizing this now. I don’t even understand why are you adding an extra $4 to just bring our dog. And on top of that, we have to pay more due to the weather. I strongly don’t agree with the changes you guys have made.

However, since the pandemic which ultimately triggered in March for the U.S. the pool option on UBER  was no longer available- this was due to the social distancing regulations that were put into place.  With that said the pool was way more efficient for me and many other users, as I surveyed customers trips (mainly because it was way less to travel with someone) rather then call an UBER X and ride alone. 
As a very big customer I feel if we don’t bring this pool back anytime soon customers are going to shift to cheaper , more affordable prices.  UBER will certainly maintain status if it prices stay at a descent price for customers.  Happy customers make great companies. THANKS UBER for your commitment.

Usually things work out well, but wanted to give some feedback to the company. Not sure how to otherwise. 
I’m having frequent issues with the driver “arriving “ but not where I am. Perhaps 100 yards down the street. But not at the specified address. Happened last night in Park City, and again today at Dulles airport. App said I should wait at “3F”, but driver called me from some random nearby parking lot. 
The worst was this morning, I had arranged, the night before, for a 7:00 am pick up at my hotel. Come 7 am, no Uber, and none seemed to be available. Ended up having to pay $135 to get a limo to the airport. Please, as I have learned, don’t assume you can expect them to show up even though you have pre-ordered a ride. They need to be more up front about these things, and I blame the app, and not necessarily the driver, hence my writing this review on the Apple App Store.",2020-12-13 01:18:02

"Dark, Greedy Interface Patterns","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1159789213","jmgtscc77134","3.434.10005","1","The interface for ordering food within this application is overly rigid and forces the user into inconvenient situations when you need to edit an order.
 I was placing an order for delivery with my girlfriend (on her phone) and was at a different address than the last place we had ordered food from. Uber auto filled the address with the most recent and then, when I confirmed my order, gave me a two second timer to cancel with a warning saying “it looks like you’re not located near this delivery address”. I missed the cancel window (of literally two or three seconds) and then the app finalized the order and when I went to change the address, it would not allow me. When I went to cancel and reorder with the proper address, it said the fee would be $50 ( total cost of food minus fees). Mind you this is all within a minute of me placing the order, not 10 minutes after. 
What is this garbage? I know from ordering pickup through Uber (where Uber doesn’t collect fees) that I have to click TWO confirmation modals to confirm that I want pickup over delivery. Why then, when someone is clearly not near their selected delivery location, does Uber auto-confirm the order and then prevent any changes to the delivery address? This is clearly a tactic used to force users to keep their orders even when a mistake was made. How about adding a simple form to the application to change the order address? I’m a software developer and know that this was a decision made by a product team that chose higher revenue over customer satisfaction. That is a long term recipe for failure and loss of customer loyalty. I’m deleting this application. Good riddance",2020-12-12 00:46:09

 After years of using the service Uber I must say they never let me down. I currently hold a 4.97 rating and my drivers really represent that. Holding each other to a certain standard when driving is important. As well as mutual respect. With uber being such a simple app to navigate really anyone can use it. It offers the change to also make the right choice. aAfter a night of drinking with buddies you can get a safe, reliable ride home using this app. This is the first time something like this has been available. OF course we have taxi service but it is not the same. Drivers often offer free water and phone charger upon arrival. After being out, charging your phone is a real treat due to it generally being dead. Not only do they have regular rides you can select different vehicle options at different price points. If you need a car for a larger party you can select that when placing your pickup location. For example you're spending the day snowboarding. On the app you can request a car with a ski rack to store your gear for a warm ride back to your lodge. Another advantage to it is you see the price of the ride before it's placed so it's not a surprise. All together I really enjoy this app as a safe way to travel and a reliable way as well. I would strongly recommend it and therefore I give it a 5 star rating.",2020-12-07 22:43:06

I also don’t understand why my ratings keep going down. I’m always outside 99% of the time, very kind to the drivers, and A lot of times tip the drivers.

I’ve had minor issues before but, this one is too much. Yesterday I placed an order to be picked up at work and have them take a young man who needed a ride home. He was not feeling well and so I did my best to accommodate him with an Uber in the freezing cold. Upon opening up the app it had my location at my work place. I proceeded to press the destination section and enter the address. A small amount of time goes by and a driver is assigned my order. After about a minute or so of watching the driver’s position on screen I notice he is heading away from my current location. I figured maybe he had another client to pick up and drop off before getting to me. That was not the case. I see the app changes from him being on the way to now we are on route to destination. He has picked someone up at a location approximately 2 miles away from me and is bringing them to my intended destination. I call him to ask where he is going because he has yet to pick me up. He says he is almost there! I said but who is in the car you did not pick me up? He mumbles to himself and hangs up the phone. The man had a very strong accent and spoke with limited vocabulary. Meanwhile, I’m supposed to be at work training supervisors and overseeing part our operation. My favorite was Uber’s expert anti-customer service philosophy. In short, because the destination you chose and the destination we dropped the wrong party off at we’re similar we won’t be giving you a refund. I reached out to their “help” section through the app and have received people equivalent to a wall or as I suspect an automated response system. Three people at Uber all repeated the same rhetoric. I explained multiple times you don’t get it!!! Your driver never picked me up. He never confirmed his party as is his job!!! In fact, he orchestrated giving his friend a ride on my dime and Uber team and their App support are supporting this behavior. Now they are threatening to block me as a user because I am not happy about them allowing someone to steal my money while they sit back and allow it. Resolution: take responsibility for your lack of training with your drivers, take customer service and hospitality training, learn to use the GPS function to support people’s statements when they tell you you never picked me up. Best of all their chat support actually had the Gaul to tell me they don’t have a way of contacting me via phone. You are stealing money and I want mine back.

"Uber is a parasitic business","https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id1146848891","benjovt","3.431.10001","1","Last month California voters passed Prop 22, safeguarding the right of gig economy companies to misclassify their workers as contractors and pay them sub-minimum wages, withhold benefits, evade payroll and unemployment taxes, etc.

Uber/Lyft spent $200m to secure that win.

As Prop 22's promoters remind us: Gig work is the new unemployment benefit: it's a private-sector jobs guarantee, work you can get at the tap of your screen. It's a perfect labor market – workers effectively bid to offer the best price to perform servant work for others.

The more workers there are, and the more desperate their situation is, the lower the payments go. A lot of those savings are siphoned off by the (money-losing, stock-soaring) gig companies, but some of it is passed onto customers.

This is by design.",2020-11-21 01:19:20

The drivers were all very kind and professional. Each time we were ready and waiting for the driver to arrive. I noticed that after the trip there was always an additional $0.50 to $1 charge. When I looked up what the charge was for I found out that Uber charges a per minute wait fee from when the driver arrives to when we leave.
